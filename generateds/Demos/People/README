This directory contains a simple example of the use of
generateDS.py.  The following files are provided:

- people_7.xsd -- This is the XML Schema file used to generate
  peoplesup.py and peoplesub.py

- peoplesup.py and peoplesub.py -- Generated from people.xsd.
  peoplesup.py contains the superclasses; peoplesub.py contains
  the generated subclasses. They were generated by running the
  following:

      $ generateDS.py --session=a7.session

  Or:

      $ ../../generateDS.py -f -m \
        --namespacedef='xmlns:pl="http://kuhlman.com/people.xsd"' \
        --super=peoplesup -o peoplesup.py -s peoplesub.py \
        --member-specs=dict \
        people_7.xsd

  Or, if you want validator bodies:

      $ ../../generateDS.py -f -m \
        --validator-bodies=Validators \
        --namespacedef='xmlns:pl="http://kuhlman.com/people.xsd"' \
        --super=peoplesup -o peoplesup.py -s peoplesub.py \
        --member-specs=dict \
        people_7.xsd

  Notice that because the validator bodies sub-directory
  Validators contains a file named percent.py, you should see that
  the method validate_percent in class person in the generated
  file peoplesup.py as been filled in with a body.

- people_7.xml -- A data file used to test peoplesup.py and
  peoplesub.py.  Run the following to test it:

      $ python peoplesup.py people_7.xml

  Or,

      $ python peoplesub.py people_7.xml

  Note that you might need to edit the subclass file
  (peoplesub.py), changing the import supermod statement, and run
  that modified file.  This modification is possibly not needed if
  you used the --super= flag.
